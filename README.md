# SublimeKSP

A Sublime Text 3 plugin for working with and compiling KSP (Kontakt Script Processor) code.

### Changes
This fork is based on [Nils Liberg's official SublimeKSP plugin, v1.11](http://nilsliberg.se/ksp/), and likewise supports Kontakt versions 5.6 and up. However, there are a number of additions and changes:

* Additions to the preprocessor allowing for UI arrays, new macro types and more
* Available in Package Control, which supports automatic updates
* Updates to the syntax highlighting
* Support for Creator Tools GUI Designer
* default_syntax.py has been removed since this can be set elsewhere
* See the [Added Features](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/wiki/Added-Features) section of the [Wiki](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/wiki) for more information
