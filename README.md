## SublimeKSP

A Sublime Text 3 plugin for working with and compiling Kontakt script code 
(KSP code).

### Changes
This fork is based on [Nils' official 1.11 plugin](http://nilsliberg.se/ksp/), and likewise supports Kontakt version 5.6. However there are some additions and minor changes:

* Additions to the preprocessor allowing for UI arrays, new macro types and more, see the added features section of the wiki
* Now available in Package Control which supports auto updates
* Some changes to the syntax highlighting
* default_syntax.py has been removed since this can be set elsewhere

### Installation

* Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)
* After installing Package Control and restarting Sublime:
  * Open the Command Palette from the Tools menu or <kbd>Command</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>P</kbd> (OS X) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>P</kbd> (Windows)
  * Type “Install Package”
  * Type “KSP” or "Kontakt" and select "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)"
  * Hit Enter to install
  * Restart Sublime
