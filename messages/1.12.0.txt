Version 1.12.0
---------------------------------------------------

This release brings us the following:

-New commands introduced in Kontakt 7.0.11!

-Two new SublimeKSP commands: iterate_post_macro() and literate_post_macro(), which are variants of iterate/literate_macro() that are
executed after macro expansion, which means one could use #macro_arguments# as define constants in these new commands.
For example: literate_post_macro(declare #l#) on #obj#.CONTROLS is now possible!

-Fix for watch_array_idx() not accepting string or real arrays as an argument (when "Extra Syntax Checks" was enabled)

-Consequently, prior to this version it was possible to pass a real array to load/save_array() commands, which doesn't work in Kontakt.
This is now remedied, so these commands will only ever accept integer and string arrays

-Last but not the least: there was a superfluous trailing space in the compiled output for all UI widget declaration lines,
which will not happen anymore


---------------------------------------------------

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like here: https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases
With your SublimeKSP package downloaded, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:
1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the `SublimeKSP` folder out of the zip file and place it into this folder.
3. Restart Sublime completely. Make sure it is not running in your OS task manager (or, restart the computer to be thorough!)
