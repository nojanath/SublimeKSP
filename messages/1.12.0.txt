Version 1.12.0
---------------------------------------------------

This release brings us the following:

-New commands introduced in Kontakt 7.0.11!

-Two new SublimeKSP commands: iterate_post_macro() and literate_post_macro(), which are variants of iterate/literate_macro() that are
executed after macro expansion, which means one could use #macro_arguments# as define constants in these new commands.
For example: literate_post_macro(declare #l#) on #obj#.CONTROLS is now possible!

-Fix for watch_array_idx() not accepting string or real arrays as an argument (when "Extra Syntax Checks" was enabled)

-Consequently, prior to this version it was possible to pass a real array to load/save_array() commands, which doesn't work in Kontakt.
This is now remedied, so these commands will only ever accept integer and string arrays

-Last but not the least: there was a superfluous trailing space in the compiled output for all UI widget declaration lines,
which will not happen anymore


---------------------------------------------------

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)` (this is important so that your settings from Package Control version are retained)!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed.
