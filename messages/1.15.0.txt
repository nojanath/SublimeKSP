Version 1.15.0
---------------------------------------------------

This version brings support for Kontakt 7.3 additions, a number of bugfixes and even more syntax coloring improvements, as well as the announced removal of the Logger module.

- Fixed get_ui_id() being inserted in various situations when it shouldn't have been added (for example when using an array when setting $CONTROL_PAR_PARENT_PANEL etc.)

- Fixed a couple of issues that prevented compilation from command line in certain cases

- Fixed #n# token not being replaced inside strings when using inline literate/iterate_macro()

- Info bar line in Sublime Text will now report how long the compilation lasted upon successful compilation

- If compiling from command line and output file argument wasn't specified, the compiler will notify the user about it upon successful compilation

- Added NI_ZONE_STATUS_ constants to builtins, which somehow managed to evade being included around Kontakt 7.1 times!

- redirect_midi() command now has its arguments properly documented

- Arrow shorthand notation for event parameters didn't work with functions like by_marks(), now it does

- Added more syntax checks (when Extra syntax checks option is enabled) relevant to UI control declarations, and arguments which can be both integer and real (like for the sort() command)

- Minor tweaks to KScript Dark theme for improved contrast

- Cleaned up several files in the repository for better readability

- Even more syntax coloring improvements, for example previously %CONTROL_PAR_VALUE would colorize as a valid control parameter, when it isn't valid - now it doesn't anymore; using macro tokens inside variable declarations didn't colorize properly, now it does

- Completions list now looks the same in Sublime Text 4 as it does in Sublime Text 3 (function arguments are listed in parentheses after function name)

- Fixed an error where all functions that had no arguments in the completion list ended up with closed parentheses (for example, exit()) which was incorrect

- Added several more unit tests to keep us on our toes so that we don't break things in the future

- Added .bat and .sh scripts to run tests locally (requires Python 3 to be installed and added to PATH environment variable)

- Removed duplicate callbacks warning that was triggered too early in the compilation process

- Removed Logger functionality - we recommend using Creator Tools with watch_var()/watch_array_idx() commands instead!


Thanks as always to Jack Williams from Fracture Sounds for solving some of the tricky ones from the above list!


Have fun!


---------------------------------------------------

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)` (this is important so that your settings from Package Control version are retained)!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed
