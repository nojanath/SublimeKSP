Version: 1.6.1

New features:
- Syntactic sugar for binary numbers. Type `b` at the end of a number for LSB-right, for example `1100b` is 12. `b` at the beginning is LSB-left, where `b1100` is 3.
- Linux Keymap file has been added.
- List adds can now be used inside of other blocks, such as ifs, whiles, and fors.

Bug Fixes:
- Coloring for `list` keyword has been corrected.
- Fixed a float compilation bug where using int_to_real() inside a literal expression with a resulting whole number (like `int_to_real(1000)/20.0`) would result in compiling to scientific notation (like `5e1`) instead of decimal point notation (like `50.0`).
- Fixed CONTROL_PAR_CURSOR_PICTURE not being supported.
