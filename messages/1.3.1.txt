Bugs fixed:

* Multidimensional arrays now work in ui_commands.
* Multidimensional arrays now work variable installations.
* Fixed bug with compiler giving wrong line number in error messages.

Changes to activate_logger:

* File path should now include the file name. For backwards compatibly, if no file name is given, there will be one auto generated (not recommended). Files should be nka format. activate_logger("C:/SynthsLogger.nka")
* The system is more robust, helpful error messages will be generated if the filename is invalid.
* The logger script now uses the persistence_changed callback and a while loop. The previous system with pgs was too buggy and inefficient in Kontakt. This means that to use activate_logger you need to be using Kontakt v5.5 or above. The messages are not printed instantly, there is a 0.2 second delay for efficiency reasons. However, the order in which they appear is guaranteed to be correct.

Misc:

* Option in the tools menu of sublime for 'Compact output' has been remained to 'Remove indents and empty lines'. I felt that 'compact output' implies something more than what it actually does, which is simply remove whitespace.
* Arrays with unspecified size now have a constant variable generated. These are the array name with .SIZE appended to the end.
* Added new UI functions to autocomplete.
* General tidy up and a few more comments.
* iterate_macro() snippet.
