Version 1.17.0
---------------------------------------------------

This version brings support for Kontakt 7.6 additions (including NKS2 parameter descriptive information and navigation commands!), along with several fixes.

- Added support for real array arguments in load/save_array(_str) commands. This was supposed to be there in 7.5, alas...

- Fixed missing Raum engine parameters ($ENGINE_PAR_RAUM_REVERB, $ENGINE_PAR_RAUM_PREDELAY_UNIT)

- Fixed incorrectly named engine parameter for Raum Low Shelf (it was $ENGINE_PAR_RAUM_LOWCUT instead of $ENGINE_PAR_RAUM_LOWSHELF)

- Fixed superfluous closed parentheses appearing in auto-completion suggestions for certain commands

- Updated the list of functions with forced parentheses with all remaining commands that weren't there yet


Have fun!

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)` (this is important so that your settings from Package Control version are retained)!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed
