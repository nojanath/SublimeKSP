If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like here: https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases
With your SublimeKSP package downloaded, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:
1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the `SublimeKSP` folder out of the zip file and place it into this folder.
3. Restart Sublime completely. Make sure it is not running in your OS task manager (or, restart the computer to be thorough!)
