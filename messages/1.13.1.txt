Version 1.13.1
---------------------------------------------------

This is a hotfix update resolving a couple of issues from 1.13.0.

- Macro argument expansion within strings still didn't work with literate/iterate macros

- Certain scripts wouldn't compile properly due to lacking regular expression for parsing real numbers. This is now much improved

- Binary numbers would be colorized as valid numbers even if they contained digits other than 0 and 1!

- Negative numbers wouldn't have their minus sign syntax colorized if they were right next to brackets []

- Added a few more tests to cover above cases


Thanks again to Jack Williams from Fracture Sounds for doing most of the heavy lifting!


Have fun!

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)` (this is important so that your settings from Package Control version are retained)!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed
