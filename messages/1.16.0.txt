Version 1.16.0
---------------------------------------------------

This version brings support for Kontakt 7.5 additions and a couple of interesting new features.

- Added overloaded macros - different macros can now be executed based on different number of arguments they have!

- Added the capability for "override" keyword which allows user-defined functions to override built-in functions

- Added an error in case a duplicate define is being declared (issue #380)

- Added a new comment type: section comment {{ }}, which will also show up in the symbol list (Ctrl/Cmd+R), making it easier to create named bookmark jumps in the code

- Fixed persistence shorthands not working if they come after "ui_control" keyword (issue #379)



Thanks to Jack Williams from Fracture Sounds for implementing overloaded macros and expanding the usage of "override" keyword!


Have fun!

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)` (this is important so that your settings from Package Control version are retained)!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed
