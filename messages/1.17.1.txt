Version 1.17.1
---------------------------------------------------

This is a minor update with the following changes:

- Improved detection of duplicate defines - now both the name and the value of a define have to match in order to throw a compiler error

- Removed $ENGINE_PAR_RAUM_MIX because it is not a valid engine parameter

- Added support for importing whole folders in one go, instead of listing them file by file

- Pressing Alt+O with cursor focused on the line which imports a folder will show all .ksp files within that folder in a new Sublime Text window


Have fun!

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)` (this is important so that your settings from Package Control version are retained)!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed.
