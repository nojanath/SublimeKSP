Version 1.20.0
---------------------------------------------------

This update adds support for everything that was newly introduced with Kontakt 8.0, along with the following changes:

- Added support for f-strings! These enable way easier concatenation of expressions in strings. Use <> tags to enclose the expression, for example: f'The value of variable a is: <a>.'

- Fixed return types for sgn() and signbit() commands - these can return either integer or real depending on context, so they should work like abs() already did

- Fixed the behavior of optimize_code and additional_branch_optimization pragmas to match CLI behavior (they should have automatically enabled extra_syntax_checks if it wasn't explicitly called)

- Fixed -> max_value and -> min_value shorthands not being syntax colored

- Fixed save_compiled_source pragma not working with a relative path that is just a .txt file without a parent folder

- Updated activation triggers for many snippets to contain the whole word, (for example "family" instead of "fam")



Thanks to Nabeel from Impact Soundworks (@eitherys) for f-string support!


Have fun!

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)` (this is important so that your settings from Package Control version are retained)!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed.
