Version: 1.6.3

Notes:
-This update is being provided with emergency timing by request of a specific feature from a developer. I still plan to do a more comprehensive update addressing issues that have been reported in the GitHub tracker at a later date.

Updates:

-iterate_macro() statements can now use macro #argument#s in their min and max values. Example:
	```macro create_controls(#num_controls#)
		iterate_macro(declare ctrl_#n#) := 0 to #num_controls# - 1
	end macro

	on init
		create_controls(7)
	end on```

-EvilDragon has added a number of define constants to the compiler that contain time information strings for when the script is compiled:
	__SEC__
	__MIN__
	__HOUR__
	__HOUR12__
	__AMPM__
	__DAY__
	__MONTH__
	__YEAR__
	__YEAR2__
	__LOCALE_MONTH__
	__LOCALE_MONTH_ABBR__
	__LOCALE_DATE__
	__LOCALE_TIME__

	For instance, `message("Today is " & __LOCAL_DATE__ & " at " & __LOCAL_TIME__)` will compile, if right now, to `message("Today is 04/30/18 at 19:10:00")`.

-EvilDragon also updatad the syntax coloring to prevent the `to` keyword from being highlighted as a special keyword when it is used as a macro argument #to#.
