Version 1.9.2

New (and much-needed) improvements:
- Sublime's autocomplete now supports variables starting with `$` prefixes. Requested by many!
- The Log File Debugger, TCM module, and NI nckp (for Creator Tools GUI) import steps are now all properly supported if used inside of imported files.
	Previously, they would only work if contained in the file the compilation was run on.
- When referencing controls in an NI performance view where any control names contain double-underscores `__`, SublimeKSP can correctly use dots (`.`) as a replacement token.
    For example, a control like `Editor__Panel__Control1` can be referenced in code as `Editor.Panel.Control1` and compile correctly.
- Added a snippet for using START_INC() to help devs remember the END_INC.

Bugfix:
- When using `declare const` to assign to an NI KSP constant (for example `declare const BLUE := KEY_COLOR_BLUE`) with code optimization enabled, SublimeKSP would not compile.
    The only fix for this is to disable optimization for these specific constants, and they will show up in the compiled code as they would in vanilla KSP.
