Version 1.14.0
---------------------------------------------------

This is a sizable update, improving many little and some larger things in the compiler, while also bringing support for new additions in Kontakt 7.2!

- Added an option to sanitize the behavior of "exit" KSP command, which works around a nasty bug where it will collapse the whole function call tree in certain situations (issue #299)

- Added pragma directives to force specific compiler options (issue #240) - this way a script can be compiled with its required settings without manually changing options every time!

- Added a new command to open the file import command and save_compiled_source pragma point to: Press Alt+O (Opt+O on Mac) while the cursor is focused on the line containing the file path!

- save_compiled_source pragma directive can now be used multiple times, to save the compiled code in multiple locations in one go (issue #326)

- Updated behavior of command line switches: --force (or -f) switch was added to enforce other compiler option switches, otherwise pragmas take precedence, if they have been defined

- Added another define substitution step after l/iterate_post_macro() (thanks to @eitherys)

- Improved log message for successful compilation (now also shows paths where compiled code ended up)

- As of this version, Logger functionality is considered deprecated in favor of variable watching and debugger panel in Creator Tools. Logger will be removed completely in version 1.15!

- Further autocomplete improvements, supporting snippets in ST4, showing function arguments and return type, control and event pars now properly autocomplete after '->', and so on (issue #287)

- Several snippets have been slightly updated

- SublimeKSP options menu will now properly show checkmarks on Linux (thanks to @teskdop!)

- Improved compiler's back-end structure for ingesting definitions of built-ins, which now supports functions that have optional arguments (like search() in Kontakt 7.2)

- Improved syntax coloring for function/macro/taskfunc calls

- Improved syntax coloring for variable declaration

- Improved checking for declare constants - now they HAVE to have a value assigned (issue #331)

- Improved indentation patterns (issue #293)

- Functions can now be used alongside -> control/event par shorthands, for example to use by_marks() -> volume, etc. (issue #311)

- When assigning parent panels using -> shorthand syntax, wrap the assigned variable inside get_ui_id() (issue #335)

- Added iterate_post_macro and literate_post_macro to syntax coloring

- Sublime's Goto Definition was broken due to SublimeKSP registering an indexed symbol list - we think this is a bug in Sublime Text (issue #289)

- Fixed a crash if attempting to recompile quickly after starting a compilation: SublimeKSP won't attempt to join threads anymore, instead it will either stop current compilation then restart it (if attempting to recompile existing file), or present a log message to wait until current compilation is done (if attempting to compile a different file)

- Fixed a typo in Combine Callbacks function (issue #276) and compile error when declaring a list (issue #279)

- Fixed an issue where Combine Callbacks option was doing some unauthorized code compacting even if it was disabled (issue #324)

- Fixed Extra Syntax Checks and Optimize Compiled Code options being grayed out in the menu on a fresh SublimeKSP install

- Fixed incorrect argument type specified for sgn() and signbit() functions (issue #316)

- Fixed Recompile Last Script option not working (issue #315)

- Fixed an issue where using certain functions as assignments to constants can work in vanilla KSP but not SublimeKSP (issue #222)

- Preprocessor injected variable declarations will never be namespaced, nor attempted to be declared multiple times, fixing certain compile errors (issue #309)

- Minor internal restructuring of the repository - as a consequence, running the compiler from command line won't show Python deprecation warnings anymore


Thanks again to Jack Williams from Fracture Sounds for doing a lot of the heavy lifting!


Have fun!


---------------------------------------------------

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)` (this is important so that your settings from Package Control version are retained)!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed
