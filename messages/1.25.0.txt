Version 1.25.0
---------------------------------------------------

This update is quite light, nonetheless it had to happen. :) Only three bullet points this time:

- ADDED Support for new engine parameters in Kontakt 8.8
- FIXED abs(), sgn() and signbit() support arrays as argument (for example abs(foo[1]), which works in vanilla KSP, did not work in SublimeKSP - now it does)
- IMPROVED Compilation error messages now don't contain Python tracebacks anymore, and the verbiage of the error as far as line count is now slightly updated


That's all - have fun!


---------------------------------------------------

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)` (this is important so that your settings from Package Control version are retained)!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed.
