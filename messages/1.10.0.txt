Version 1.10.0
---------------------------------------------------

With SublimeKSP 1.10.0 comes a few improvements to the compilation process as well as full support for Kontakt 6.4 engine parameters.

-Syntax now supports Kontakt 6.4 engine & NI parameters
-There was an issue where strings were calling define macros inside of them if matching any names (for example, using the word "sum" would call a define macro `sum()` if it existed)
-Compilation now correctly allows variables that start with a number when using persistence shorthands (`pers` and `read`)
-When using `literate_macro`, #n# now supports replacing the index of the #l# constant in the LITERALS define.

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)` (this is important so that your settings from Package Control version are retained)!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed
