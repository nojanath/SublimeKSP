Bug fixes:
- Bug with using tabs in define statements.
- Similarly named lists now work.

New syntax:
- New list blocks. Instead of using a whole load of list_add() commands, you can declare a list and assign it a set of values in a code block. list_add() still works as normal. There is also a constant variable for the list size generated.

- New constant integer blocks. You can create a set of constant integers in a block. The value of the constants can optionally be automatic, by default the first is 0 and each one after is the previous + 1. There is also an integer array generated, though as usual if you do not use it, the compiler will omit it when 'Optimise compiled code' is on.

- New shorthand for read_persistent_var(). For any variable you can use the keyword 'read' to both make the variable persistent and also read its persistent value. The 'pers' keyword only makes it persistent.

- New define functionality. You can use define as a literal text substitution macro. To do this, sandwich the value with # symbols. The text inside the # is replaced at the location you use the define, so be careful with this.
