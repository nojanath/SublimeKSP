Version 1.9.9

Fixed a bug where using any define macro names inside of strings would attempt to evaluate them instead of leaving them as string content.

For example:

```
define real(x) := int_to_real(x)
on init
message("Ready for real-time audio!")
end on
```

This code would attempt to evaluate real as a function and cause the compiler to error due to lack of arguments.
