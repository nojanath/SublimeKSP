Version: 1.4.0

Big additions:

- Defines can now accept arguments to act like single line macros (and other improvements).
- Structs; a way of grouping together variables into a structure.
- Preprocessor section of the compiler is now much faster.
- New colour scheme "Monokai KSP" thanks to Davide Magni.

Other changes:

- Defines no longer require ## symbols for literal text substitutions - this is now handled automatically.
- Multidimensional arrays can now be initialised with a list (in the same way you would a single dim array).
- All elements in a string array can be initialised by just assigning it to a single string.
- 'define literals' are deprecated as the newly enhanced define can handle this.
- Better support for declaring variables inside families.
- Fix Kontakt constant NI_CB_TYPE_ASYNC_COMPLETE.
- Behind the scenes, activate_logger() now assigns the save_array() function to variable LOGGER_ASYNC_ID so that it can be filtered out of the async callback if required.
- Capitalise text in KSP tools menu to be more consistent with the rest of Sublime.
