Version 1.24.0
---------------------------------------------------

This update adds support for new engine parameters introduced in Kontakt 8.4, a few of fixes and a new const block feature.

- ADDED Support for new event and engine parameters (Reverb Delight, $EVENT_PAR_OUTPUT_TYPE, $EVENT_PAR_OUTPUT_INDEX)

- ADDED Const blocks get additional auto-generated variables and constants (.str[] for names of entries, .title for the name of the const block itself, .idx for the index of the const block entry)

- FIXED Compiler hangup resulting in huge .log files

- IMPROVED Error message when UI callback definition is incorrect is much clearer now (issue #446)


Thanks to Nabeel from Impact Soundworks (@eitherys) for the compiler hangup fix!


That's all - have fun!

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)` (this is important so that your settings from Package Control version are retained)!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed.
