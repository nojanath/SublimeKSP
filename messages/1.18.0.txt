Version 1.18.0
---------------------------------------------------

This update adds support for new engine parameters and callback type introduced with Kontakt 7.8, along with the following changes:

- Added an option which enables completions for vanilla KSP built-in constants and variables (with $, %, etc. type prefixes)

- Added `.SIZE` define for literal defines (issue #99)

- Added an error message if function declaration has duplicate argument names

- Added a compiler option to enable additional branch optimization steps - this allows using if-else with defines, which can be used in many interesting ways

- Added += and =* operators to defines, which allows appending or prepending a literal define to the existing list of literals - see Wiki for more info!

- Improved internal structure of built-ins data file, which enables using vanilla KSP built-in constants as they were supposed to be used
  (previously you couldn't use these to, for example, specify array size upon declaration)

- Improved automatic syntax detection (SublimeKSP will automatically switch syntax to KSP if enough keywords have been detected in the first 5000 characters of currently focused document)

- Improved syntax coloring of `pers`, `instpers` and `read` keywords when they are placed after the UI widget specifier

- Further improved command line interface: `output_file` argument is now completely optional; `save_compiled_source` pragmas are now disregarded if `output_file` argument is specified

- Fixed operator precedence for or, xor, .or. and .xor. operators

- Fixed task function `return` and `out` parameters not working correctly (issue #217)

- Fixed an issue where multi-dimensional arrays clashed with Combine Callbacks feature (issue #389)

- Fixed "Optimize Compiled Code" option breaking with bitwise operators (issue #423)

- Fixed `$CONTROL_PAR_CUSTOM_ID` missing from syntax coloring


Have fun!


---------------------------------------------------

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)` (this is important so that your settings from Package Control version are retained)!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed.
