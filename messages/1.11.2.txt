Version 1.11.2
---------------------------------------------------

Urgent update after an issue noticed by Nabeel Ansari and Sarah Mancuso that would affect Mac users using Git!

-When checking the "save_compiled_source" pragma directive, the resulting file path was not stripped from whitespaces,
 so there could be added whitespaces after the last character in the file extension. This can create problems with Git
 repositories, so now this path has been stripped of trailing and leading whitespaces, just to be safe

And a very minor change as well:

-Removed "Insert Comments When Expanding Functions" option, since it never really worked, actually

---------------------------------------------------

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `SublimeKSP`!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed
