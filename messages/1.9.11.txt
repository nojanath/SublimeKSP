---------------------------------------------------

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `SublimeKSP`!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed
