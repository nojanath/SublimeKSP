Version 1.9.10
---------------------------------------------------

This is a fix for comment bugs when mixing comment styles ( {} , /* */ , and // ).

When using a // (open-ended) comment inside of a close-ended comment like {} or /* */, the compiler was removing the end closure of the outer comment.
The comment would then hang indefinitely until the next closure of the same style and ignore potentially large portions of the code after perceiving it as commented.

This has now been fixed.

If you would like to roll back a version of SublimeKSP for time critical work prevented by a new bug:

First, remove SublimeKSP from Sublime Package Control:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac.
2. Type "Remove Package" and select it, then select the "KSP (Kontakt Script Processor)" entry.

Next, download the version you'd like [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/releases).

After the download, you can install it as a user package in Sublime following these instructions:

1. Open the Preferences menu in Sublime Text and click Browse Packages. A folder will open up.
2. Extract the ZIP archive you have downloaded and place it into this folder.
3. IMPORTANT: Rename the unpacked folder to `SublimeKSP`!
4. Restart Sublime Text. Alternatively, make sure you have [Automatic​Package​Reloader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutomaticPackageReloader) package installed
